                                <p>
                                        Football is one of the hobbies that attracted me from very young age.
                                        I personally love football because it keeps me healthy both
                                        mentally and physically.

                                        This hobby is injected in my veins since childhood. All the action
                                        movies and cartoons made me develop my interest in visual graphics,
                                        making me sit on the pc for the very first time to play gta vice-city.

                                        Reading books was never my thing. Infact, I hated books in my
                                        childhood even in my early teenage years. But as I started
                                        to observe and got exposure I realized books are one of the
                                        best habits a person can adapt. Since i realized this reading
                                        books became my hobby.

                                <p>
                                        As growing up comes with a lot of experiences and exposure.
                                        In my teenage years I was an extrovert and mischevious boy who
                                        liked to hang out with friends and gaming and all that stuff.
                                        Even though it was all good and enjoyable but at some time it
                                        became boring and exhausting and then I realized that these
                                        materials cannot make me happy always, the thing i was always
                                        looking was peace and inner sastisfaction which I found in Islam.
                                        Since then learning about my religion and implementing on it became
                                        my first priority and interests.

                                        Being an extrovert always attracted me to people and large
                                        gatherings. Going to social gathering or meetups just brings
                                        hell lot of energy in me. I have learned valuable things from
                                        interacting with people and observing their traits. This habit
                                        of mine has helped me in gaining confidence and helped me in
                                        learning public speaking.
