                        <h3>Learning Religion</h3>
                        <p>
                                As growing up comes with a lot of experiences and exposure.
                                In my teenage years I was an extrovert and mischevious boy who
                                liked to hang out with friends and gaming and all that stuff.
                                Even though it was all good and enjoyable but at some time it
                                became boring and exhausting and then I realized that these
                                materials cannot make me happy always, the thing i was always
                                looking was peace and inner sastisfaction which I found in Islam.
                                Since then learning about my religion and implementing on it became
                                my first priority and interests.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Gathering And Meetups</h3>
                        <p>
                                Being an extrovert always attracted me to people and large
                                gatherings. Going to social gathering or meetups just brings
                                hell lot of energy in me. I have learned valuable things from
                                interacting with people and observing their traits. This habit
                                of mine has helped me in gaining confidence and helped me in
                                learning public speaking.
